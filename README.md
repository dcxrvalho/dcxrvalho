#  About Me

Hi there!  
I'm a Computer Science student at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), with a strong interest in backend development.

I have experience with **Python**, **Java**, and **C++**, and I'm currently learning **SQL** and **JavaScript** to expand my skills in database management and web development. I'm also diving deeper into data structures and algorithms.
